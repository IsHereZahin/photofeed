## 📋 About

**PhotoFeed** is a full-featured frontend application created as a part of a learning journey. Built with **Next.js App Router**, it supports both English and Bangla languages, dynamic routing, modals, and responsive design. It consumes data from a backend API and displays user-shared images in a modern UI.

> **Note:** This is a frontend-only project. You will need the backend API running separately to use all features.
